## Description:
  Offline budget tracker is an app that allows you to keep track of expenses and income in one user-friendly spot. You can add the name of your expense or method of income, the amount, and then whether you would like to add this amount to your total or subtract it. The best part is your transactions are all stored so in the event that you are offline you are still able to save these transactions, which will post as soon as your connection is re-established.
  ## Installation Instructions:
  To install: clone repository, run npm install in your terminal to add needed dependencies. Start server by running "node server" in your terminal while in the develop folder, the terminal will tell you what PORT you are running on then go to "localhost:" + PORT in your browser.
  ## Usage Information:
  This app is intended for those who want to be able to keep track of their income and expenses, even while offline.
